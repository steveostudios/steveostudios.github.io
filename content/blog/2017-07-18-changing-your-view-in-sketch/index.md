I’ve looked and I can’t seem to find a single, comprehensive list of all the tricks and keyboard shortcuts to change a view in Sketch. So I decided to try and make one.

## Zooming

|                                     |                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ⌘ + +                               | Zoom in.                                          |
| ⌘ + –                               | Zoom out.                                         |
| ⌘ + 0                               | Show actual size of the canvas (1px is 1px).      |
| ⌘ + 1                               | Zoom and center all of the elements in your page. |
| ⌘ + 2                               | Zoom and center the selected layer.               |
| ⌘ + 3                               | Just center the selected layer.                   |
| Hold down Z + click or drag an area | to zoom into it.                                  |
| Hold Option + Z and click           | to reverse the zoom.                              |
| Hold spacebar down, click           | and drag to pan around the canvas.                |
