So Donald Miller, author of several of my favorite books (Blue Like Jazz and A Million Miles and a Thousand Years), is speaking in Lexington this weekend for Father's Day. It's no coincidence that he would be speaking on Father's day, being that he has one book already, another coming out and a non-profit dedicated to young men that have grown up without a strong father. His passion on the subject comes from his own story of having to find influential men to become the man that he is today.

Being that I am soon going to be a father (Elliot Michael, this October) I have been doing a lot of thinking about the subject. I don't want to mess it up. And while Miller may not be an expert yet on being a father, he knows enough about what not to do, and our Heavenly Father's love that cover's no matter how bad of a father you may have had.

This morning I had this sitting on my phone:

I love her!
