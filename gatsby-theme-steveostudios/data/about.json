  "about": "<p>Hi. Iâ€™m Steve Stone. Father of three boys, husband of the most incredible woman in the world, and Christ-follower. I'm passionate about coffee, design, youth ministry, and making things.</p><p>I started out at <a href='https://www.centralonline.tv/'>Central Christian Church</a> in Las Vegas doing video production while in attending UNLV's film school. Then God called me out to Louisville, Kentucky to work at <a href='https://www.southeastchristian.org/home'>Southeast Christian Church</a>. My great friend Dave Harris and I started Digital Stache and created motion backgrounds and a few app-based games (Spin That Wheel, Scorekeep, Ready, Set Go). We also had a podcast for a few years called <a href='https://churchtechtalk.com'>Church Tech Talk</a>, ran a site called Stuff I Can Use (formerly Vine Resources), and put on a free conference for church tech folks called Gurus.</p><p>Now I work at <a href='https://www.downloadyouthministry.com/'>Download Youth Ministry</a> making apps that help youth workers, like <a href='https://sidekick.tv'>Sidekick</a>.</p>",
