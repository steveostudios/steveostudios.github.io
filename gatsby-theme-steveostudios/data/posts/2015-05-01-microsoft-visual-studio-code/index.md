As I was checking my twitter feed last night, I saw that Microsoft surprised coders with it's new [Visual Studio Code][1], successor to it's long-standing, full featured code editor.
Visual Studio Code is built from the ground up, supports a growing library of languages, a Sublime Text style Command Palette, an easy Git GUI, the ability to customize it with themes and key bindings, out-of-the-box support for ASP.net and node.js, and it's available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. You should really give it a look. Microsoft is changing their game.

And, it's all built using [Electron][2]!
