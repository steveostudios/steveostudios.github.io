However, this simple feature seems to be missing since Snow Leopard and I have been forced into memorizing IP addresses of all of our production machines…</p>\n<p>Today I found a nifty little trick to kindof solve this issue. You can create an Apple Screen Sharing bookmark in Safari, using the following scheme:</p>\n<p>vnc://ipaddress.of.machine or vnc://ipaddress.of.machine:port</p>\n<p>Pretty cool! Safari knows to open the connection and look in the keychain for the user and password…</p>\n<p>Another cool thing, is you can drag the bookmark out of Safari, into Finder, and create a folder with all of your machines that you remote into, into it. Seems a little crazy to have to do it this way, but it looks like it will work just fine. Now, I should probably find some way to lock/encrypt that folder…</p>"}
