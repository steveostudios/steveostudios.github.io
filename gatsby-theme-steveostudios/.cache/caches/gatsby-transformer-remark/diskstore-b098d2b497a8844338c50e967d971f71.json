You have to be a legitimate business, get your Apple Developer account, create and write the application, create an application ID, register devices to your account, create a provisioning profile, add certain devices to the provisioning profile, then embed the provisioning file into your application.\nAfter all of that, testers still have to get your app! This used to be tricky. You’d have to email the .ipa file to your testers and get them to drop it into iTunes, plug in their iPhone and sync everytime you update your application.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":235,"offset":689}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":235,"offset":689}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://testflightapp.com"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"TestFlight","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":2,"offset":692},"end":{"line":5,"column":12,"offset":702}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":691},"end":{"line":5,"column":16,"offset":706}}},{"type":"text","value":" aims to make this process a little LOT easier.
