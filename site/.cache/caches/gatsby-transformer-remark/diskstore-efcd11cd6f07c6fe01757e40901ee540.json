One common mistake is to set-up and shoot in front of a green screen without knowing what you are going to place your subject in front of in post. In order to make the subject “feel” like they are a part of the shot, they need to be lit similarly to the background plate. So, before I start lighting my green screen, I find or shoot the footage for the background plate. I then analyze the light sources (color, position, angle, intensity, etc.) to know where the sources will need to be in the studio.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":370},"end":{"line":3,"column":742,"offset":1111},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":370},"end":{"line":3,"column":742,"offset":1111},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lighting Scene #1 - The Screen","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":1116},"end":{"line":5,"column":34,"offset":1146},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":1113},"end":{"line":5,"column":34,"offset":1146},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Start by setting up the screen.

You can usually stretch the fabric in different ways to clean out creases and folds a little. Also, having any AC vents or fans in the proximity turned off will definitely help. Let’s get some basic math out of the way to help us find general placement of major objects. Refer to the image below to help out with this. If your green screen is X wide, then you will want your green screen lights X/4 out from the endpoints and X/2 in front, pointing towards the screen. These lights will only be used for the green screen itself. Next, your subject will need to remain outside of this lighting, which means they will need to be at least X/2 away from the green screen, but I usually add a few feet for good measure. Let’s call this distance (X/2 + a few feet) Y. Place your camera 2Y away from your subject. This will give you a good depth of field in-between your subject and green screen, which will hide some of the blemishes.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":1148},"end":{"line":7,"column":1117,"offset":2264},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":1148},"end":{"line":7,"column":1117,"offset":2264},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"html","title":null,"url":"./green-screening-101-1.jpg","alt":null,"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":2266},"end":{"line":9,"column":33,"offset":2298},"indent":[]},"value":"<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

My friend Pete told me of one other solution. Most prosumer cameras have zebra levels, which are an annoying marquee effect that applies itself to your viewfinder on ‘hot’ areas (areas of usually over 85% brightness). You can enable zebra and change the iris on the camera to see where trouble areas in brightness may be, adjust your lights and check again.

For this light I usually use my other 650w Arri with a softbox, pushed back farther in the set to make the light a little dimmer than the Key. The last light, the Back Light, is used for giving a hairline glow around the subject to add dimension. A lot of times a subjects shadow around the shoulder or darker hair can get lost in a dark background plate, making them see two-dimensional. A soft backlight can help this. Use a smaller light (I use a 125w Arri), placed behind the green screen and off to the side. It is important to watch out for lens flares here, since you are effectively pointing a light into the lens of the camera. You can either keep moving the light off axis to make sure the flare falls out of the shot, or you can use a “flag” (any solid object) that stands just out of frame to block the light. Another thing to try is to place a magenta gel in your back light. This helps by creating a magenta ring around the subject, especially the hair.
