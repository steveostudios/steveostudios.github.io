The package is completely local.</p>\n<p>After that post I decided I need to post that package somewhere, but I’m not committed enough to needing a private npmjs subscription. I wanted to find out whether or not I can post that package on a server I already own. It turns out that the wonderful folks at npm have provided a way for this!\nYou can host a package a number of different ways and use npm to pull those packages, even from other sources.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> i git+ssh://git@gitlab.com:organization/my-package<span class=\"token comment\">#1.0.0 -D</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Here are some pros to this:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>It can be private or public, depending on the repo.</li>\n<li>If you have free private repos then it’s free!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>…and the cons:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The semver distribution isn’t as cool.
