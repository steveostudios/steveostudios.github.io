{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Yesterday I wrote about how <a href=\"listacular\">Listacular is my go-to list making app</a>. Listacular doesn’t have a platform for desktop or web or plans to make either which was almost a deal-breaker for me. But, because it’s just plain text files, you can use your favorite text editor to edit your lists on any device.</p>\n<p>Now, I have <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> open on my computer all day. I use it for my meeting notes, idea dump-board, projects I am coding, you name it. So naturally, it would be awesome to have my todo list open in Sublime as well, right?</p>\n<h2>PlainTasks to the rescue</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks\">PlainTasks</a> is a free Sublime Text package that turns <code class=\"language-text\">.taskpaper</code> files into functional lists.</p>\n<p>I won’t go into all of the nooks and crannies, but if you use Sublime Text, this is definitely worth a look at. It’s super awesome.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"PlainTasks"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2015-05-08-plaintasks/"}}
