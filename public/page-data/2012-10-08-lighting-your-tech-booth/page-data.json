We’ve tried the cheap Target lamps which lasted for a few years, but I had some qualms. They got hot (being quartz lamps), they got knocked off the desks often, and the lamps would continually burn out. After that, I found some old LittleLites laying in our closet that we’re missing lamps. They’re probably ten years old. I likes these because they were dim-able and rack-mounted so they would fall off the desks. However, they frequently burned people and the lamps are super delicate. After a short run and replacing lots of lamps (we’re talking weekly, folks), I decided enough is enough.</p>\n<p>I wanted cheap LED desk lamps. My reasoning was I wanted lights that didn’t burn out as easily, that if I left on during the week wouldn’t cost a lot, didn’t burn kids, and didn’t cost an arm and a leg. The search began.</p>\n<p>Did you know that LED desk lamps are pretty expensive? I mean, there are a few cheap ones with pencil and iPod holders that are $20-30, but for one that will last more than a few weeks in our youth room we’re talking $50-60 a pop. And I was looking to buy one per position in each of our tech rooms (probably 10 total)! This was totally not doable. That’s when I stumbles upon this:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c65947d3436481751e123ac856f9ef73/31c5e/lighting-your-tech-booth.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 36.64921465968586%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Middle Atlantic Dual LED\"\n        title=\"Middle Atlantic Dual LED\"\n        src=\"/static/c65947d3436481751e123ac856f9ef73/c739e/lighting-your-tech-booth.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c65947d3436481751e123ac856f9ef73/8ee9c/lighting-your-tech-booth.jpg 148w,\n/static/c65947d3436481751e123ac856f9ef73/ebbe7/lighting-your-tech-booth.jpg 295w,\n/static/c65947d3436481751e123ac856f9ef73/c739e/lighting-your-tech-booth.jpg 590w,\n/static/c65947d3436481751e123ac856f9ef73/31c5e/lighting-your-tech-booth.jpg 764w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.middleatlantic.com/power/lt1r.htm\">Middle Atlantic Dual Gooseneck LED Single Rackmount</a></p>\n<p>There are a few major wins to this light.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>LED. Low power consumption. They won’t scar anymore children (or me!).</li>\n<li>They are bright! It only takes one of the two to light a workstation.</li>\n<li>They’re DUAL! Because we have two people per desk in our room, I can rack this light in-between them and cut cost in half!</li>\n<li>They’re rack-mountable. No more falling off the desk and breaking lamps.</li>\n<li>It’s durable. We’re talking Middle Atlantic, the company who makes road-ready, metal equipment. This is going to outlast any Target light.</li>\n<li>Only $50! That’s as much or less than I would have paid for one “cheap” LED desk lamp.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I bought a few. They are awesome. I’m going to be testing them out for a while and I’ll update this post if any of them fail, but I’m not expecting that to happen for a few years.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lighting Your Tech Booth","date":"October 08, 2012","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012-10-08-lighting-your-tech-booth/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012-04-24-testflight/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"TestFlight"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-06-13-creating-space/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating Space"}}}}}
