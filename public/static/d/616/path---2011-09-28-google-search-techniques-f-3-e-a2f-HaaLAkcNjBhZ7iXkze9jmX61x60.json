It’s impossible to know everything, but a few simple search techniques can help troubleshoot problems more efficiently. Here are a few of my favorites (syntax is in bold):</p>\n<p><strong><code class=\"language-text\">site:</code></strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes you want to search for something ONLY on a certain companies website or forum.</p>\n<p>(example: <code class=\"language-text\">chili site:foodnetworkmagazine.com</code>)</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">-</code> (hyphen)</p>\n<p>When you want to subtract something from a search, use a - (hyphen) before the word you want to subtract.</p>\n<p>(example: <code class=\"language-text\">chili -white</code>)</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">+</code> (plus sign)</p>\n<p>The plus sign directly before a word means that that word will be searched exactly as-is, without Google’s magical synonym formula. This is also especially helpful when searching commonly omitted words like “the” or “and”.</p>\n<p>(example: <code class=\"language-text\">peanut butter +and chili</code>)</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">&quot; &quot;</code> (quotes)</p>\n<p>Looking for exact phrasing can be key, especially with use of common words. Quote things to match exact phrasing.</p>\n<p>(example: <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Bob&#39;s famous chili&quot;</code>)</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">~</code> (tilda)</p>\n<p>Tilda place before a word tells Google to search not only for that word, but it’s synonyms as well.</p>\n<p>(example: <code class=\"language-text\">~tasty chili</code>)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Search Techniques","date":"September 28, 2011","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2011-09-28-google-search-techniques/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-09-16-spin-that-wheel/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spin That Wheel"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-09-28-gurus-of-tech/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gurus of Tech"}}}}
