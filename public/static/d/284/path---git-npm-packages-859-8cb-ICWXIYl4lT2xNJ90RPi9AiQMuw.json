I wanted to find out whether or not I can post that package on a server I already own. It turns out that the wonderful folks at npm have provided a way for this!\nYou can host a package a number of different ways and use npm to pull those packages, even from other sources.\nnpm i git+ssh://git@gitlab.com:organization/my-package#1.0.0 -D\nHere are some pros to this:\nIt can be private. \nit’s free</p>\n<p>yea, thats about it. \nand the pros:\nThe semver distribution isn’t as cool. It’s using a git repo and not a package version, so you have to use tags to version your package. From what I can tell it’s just not as polished.\nnpm has done a ton of amazing performance tricks to make npm sing. You don’t get that out of the box whan you host it yourself on a git service. Which is totally fair. Their made to server git, not npm packages!</p>\n<p>You can find more info here:\n<a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install\">https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Git NPM Packages","date":"July 11, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/git-npm-packages/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/local-npm-packages/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Local NPM Packages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/git-solo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Git for Solo Development"}}}}
