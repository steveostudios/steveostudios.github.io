If you haven‚Äôt already, I‚Äôd recommend you read part one.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In this article I‚Äôm going to go over my workflow when it comes to using Git and writing code. I‚Äôm by no means an expert at this, so feel free to adapt anything you see here to suit your needs!</p>\n<h2>Super Board</h2>\n<p>I feel like my brain thinks in kanbans boards. They are really clean and easy to organize your thoughts and plans, especially when the execution process is repetitive. And when it comes to a specific tool, GitLab‚Äôs Issue Boards are the second best kanban in my opinion (one being Trello). Which is great, because I already use GitLab as my remote repository and my issue tracker.</p>\n<p>I start my day going to my pinned GitLab Issue Board tab. I‚Äôll be checking this periodically through my day to regain perspective on my entire project, as well as have it ready and waiting to accrue new features an bugs as I come across them.</p>\n<h2>Work with smaller features/bugs</h2>\n<p>Another key is to separate the key problems that your solving into smaller parts and turn those into issues. A feature like ‚ÄúRedesign UI‚Äù is way too large of a task. Instead, break it down into ‚ÄúTop-nav layout‚Äù, ‚ÄúUpdate button colors‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAdd this month‚Äôs trendy image slider‚Äù. This helps in several ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It helps you think through and start to solve tasks <em>before</em> you get to coding. Simpler problems = less cognitive overload = you to move faster = ü§ì.</li>\n<li>It helps fight against scope-creep. Since that feature has already been defined, new ideas need to go somewhere else. Later you may think, ‚ÄúOh, I should also add a testimonial section to the homepage.‚Äù Great‚Ä¶ that is a <em>new issue</em>. Don‚Äôt even think about adding that to an existing feature.</li>\n<li>Smaller features means you to check off issues rapidly, giving you a boost of confidence. There is nothing more disparaging than being 2 weeks into a massive feature, drowning in loneliness. Checking off issues makes you feel like you can conquer the next one. ‚úî‚úî‚úî‚úî‚úî</li>\n<li>Seeing all of the little steps helps more accurately scope timelines. If you know each of the four tasks will take 30 minutes, you can assume your timeline is 2 hours, give or take. Quoting time on a larger task is like a carnival game‚Ää-‚Ääyou might win the teddy bear, or you might shoot your eye out.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Commit frequently</h2>\n<p>Don‚Äôt be afraid of <em>commit</em>-ment. I use to feel like I had to be happy or done with a piece of code in order to commit it. Now I realize that this is more power in committing frequently. If you‚Äôre going down a path that you realize is totally wrong, you can go back in time to <em>before</em> that mistake. And, since I can‚Äôt tell when future-me is going to want to go back in time, I commit frequently.</p>\n<h2>Set up some¬†aliases</h2>\n<p>Since Git is a command-line tool and I am terrible at typing, I let the computer help me out. I have my terminal setup using <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\" title=\"Oh My ZSH\">Oh-My-ZSH</a>, which includes some handy aliases. Here are some of my favorites:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Alias</th>\n<th>Command</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">gaa</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">git add --all</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">gc</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">git commit -v</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">gp</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">git push</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">gl</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">git pull</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">gcb</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">git checkout -b</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">gcd</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">git checkout develop</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">gpsup</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">git push --set-upstream origin $(current_branch)</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Use VS¬†Code</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" title=\"Microsoft VS Code\">Microsoft VS Code</a> has a ton of tools that help when it comes to developing with Git. Being a visual learner, and a novice at best when it comes to Git, VS Code gives me the confidence to push commit.</p>\n<p>First, if you‚Äôre current project has a repo in it, it will automatically keep track of all the changed that need staged. There is even a whole panel devoted to it! This helps because I can always see what I‚Äôve changed, and it reminds me to commit‚Ää-‚ÄäI don‚Äôt want this list to get too long! You commit right here, too! I find this easier to understand and less error prone than using the command-line. I can see exactly which files are staged, write out my message, and I don‚Äôt have to remember to <code class=\"language-text\">-m</code> my message or¬†<code class=\"language-text\">:wq</code> to exit Vim (or is it¬†<code class=\"language-text\">:qw</code>?).</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ae50df33cb31cb3bf805c98a1fc47a8d/2115b/vs-code-commit.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 73.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"VS Code Git Panel\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ae50df33cb31cb3bf805c98a1fc47a8d/4b3ab/vs-code-commit.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ae50df33cb31cb3bf805c98a1fc47a8d/f8bb1/vs-code-commit.jpg 148w,\n/static/ae50df33cb31cb3bf805c98a1fc47a8d/900ac/vs-code-commit.jpg 295w,\n/static/ae50df33cb31cb3bf805c98a1fc47a8d/4b3ab/vs-code-commit.jpg 590w,\n/static/ae50df33cb31cb3bf805c98a1fc47a8d/2115b/vs-code-commit.jpg 800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>There are also a few plugins that really make VS Code shine.

Bing, bang, boop!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I‚Äôll go over my particular workflow in another post, and show you specifically how I use Git not only as my code repository, but also my task list.
