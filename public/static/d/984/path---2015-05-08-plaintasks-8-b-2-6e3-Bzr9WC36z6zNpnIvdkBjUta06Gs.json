So naturally, it would be awesome to have my todo list open in Sublime as well, right?</p>\n<h2>PlainTasks to the rescue</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks\">PlainTasks</a> is a free Sublime Text package that turns <code class=\"language-text\">.taskpaper</code> files into functional lists.</p>\n<p>I won’t go into all of the nooks and crannies, but if you use Sublime Text, this is definitely worth a look at.
