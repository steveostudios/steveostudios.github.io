You know the drill; The endless process of selecting the right artboards or layers to export, save dialogs, output settings, overwriting files, dragging and dropping to the correct asset folder. Ugh.</p>\n<p>Sketch has a few tricks up it’s sleeve that makes this process ridiculously easy and consistent. You can use the <em>layer name</em> to specify a directory that the asset will export to? Yup! It’s hands-down one of my favorite magic tricks of Sketch!</p>\n<p>Let’s say that you’ve made this super sweet icon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./sketch-magic-export-1.jpg\" alt=\"You’re right — that *is* a super sweet icon!\"></p>\n<p>You’ve set it up to export an SVG (good job!).</p>\n<p><img src=\"./sketch-magic-export-2.jpg\" alt=\"Yay!\"></p>\n<p>You can use the layer name to specify not only the filename (myIcon), but the <em>output directory!</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"./sketch-magic-export-3.jpg\" alt=\"These layer names look a little funky — almost like paths…\"></p>\n<p>Sketch is ridiculously smart about this too!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will automatically overwrite your files by default.</li>\n<li>If the directory doesn’t exist it will create it for you.</li>\n<li>If layer name has several <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> then it will create all of the necessary directories that it needs.</li>\n<li>It even recognizes <code class=\"language-text\">../</code> as a parent directory and will traverse up! You can even do crazy complex traversing: <code class=\"language-text\">../../myFolderTwoFoldersBack</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out this configuration:\n<img src=\"./sketch-magic-export-4.jpg\" alt=\"ook where all of these assets will go on a single export.\"></p>\n<h2>How to Export</h2>\n<p>When it comes to exporting, select the assets you want to export and then use the File > Export (⇧+⌘+E) to export only the selected assets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./sketch-magic-export-5.jpg\" alt=\"Yea — I want that icon in all of those places!\"></p>\n<p>Hit Export. Select the path that you’d like to output to:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./sketch-magic-export-6.jpg\" alt=\"“Demo” — I’ll totally remember what that folder name is in 6 months…\"></p>\n<p>In my case everything will be exported relative to the “Demo” directory!</p>\n<h2>Bonus trick</h2>\n<p>You can use this same trick <em>inside the export panel!</em> The following will export an SVG in all of those folders (like before), plus create a <code class=\"language-text\">pngs</code> folder and put all of those folders/files in there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./sketch-magic-export-7.jpg\" alt=\"Multiple outputs with different folders.\"></p>\n<p>Sketch is ridiculously cool. You can save a ton of time and frustration by setting up your structure <em>within Sketch</em>, then let your computer do all of the sorting for you. After-all, isn’t that what computers are for?</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any other cool exporting tricks with Sketch!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Changing Your View in Sketch","date":"April 20, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/sketch-export-magic/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/getting-started-with-mocha/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting Started with Mocha testing in Javascript"}}}}
