I’ve spent hours reading nerdy-article after nerdy-article about MVC and the pros and cons, and how its so simple and whatnot. I understand that it is something I need to know, but my mind hasn’t grasped it yet.</p>\n<p>That all being said, I discovered Node because I wanted to do a project involving sockets, which, from my understanding can be done in almost any language, but Node developers seem to be talking non-stop about it. I also knew that I wanted an MVC for the framework of my node project. So I searched GitHub and really only found one guy who made an <a href=\"https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose-demo\">MVC framework for Node</a> that I could follow. What then transpired was 6 months of building an app that may one day see the light of day.</p>\n<p>Then, the other day I discovered <a href=\"https://sailsjs.org/\">Sails.js</a>. If you’re interested, watch the video below.</p>\n<p>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GK-tFvpIR7c\" style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe></div>\n          </div>\n          </p>\n<p>I like that it has Express, <a href=\"https://socket.io/\">Socket.io</a>, and the database already ready to go. I like that it has a ton of other features that I have heard of but have no idea what they do (yet!). I’m super stoked.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sails.js","date":"December 10, 2013","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2013-12-10-sailsjs/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-12-09-rejoice/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rejoice when it doesn't seem right"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-04-12-a-new-start/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A New Start"}}}}
