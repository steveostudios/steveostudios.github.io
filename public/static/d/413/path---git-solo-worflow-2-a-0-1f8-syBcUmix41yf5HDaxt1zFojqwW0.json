If you haven’t already, I’d recommend you read part one.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In this article I’m going to go over my workflow when it comes to using Git and writing code. I’m by no means an expert at this, so feel free to adapt anything you see here to suit your needs!</p>\n<h2>Super Board</h2>\n<p>I feel like my brain thinks in kanbans boards. They are really clean and easy to organize your thoughts and plans, especially when the execution process is repetitive. And when it comes to a specific tool, GitLab’s Issue Boards are the second best kanban in my opinion (one being Trello). Which is great, because I already use GitLab as my remote repository and my issue tracker.</p>\n<p>I start my day going to my pinned GitLab Issue Board tab. I’ll be checking this periodically through my day to regain perspective on my entire project, as well as have it ready and waiting to accrue new features an bugs as I come across them.</p>\n<h2>The Flow</h2>\n<h3>Get in the zone</h3>\n<p>☑️ Coffee</p>\n<p>☑️ Good music</p>\n<p>☑️ Quieted head-space</p>\n<h3>Find the task</h3>\n<p>Now that I am ready to go, I peruse the issue board in GitLab. I find what needs to be done next (based on estimated time to complete and priority).</p>\n<h3>Start the task</h3>\n<p>Next I do something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">git checkout develop\ngit pull\ngit checkout -b 42-fix-file-importer\ngit push --set-upstream origin</code></pre></div>\n<p>Actually, because I have aliases set up for my workflow, it looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">gcd\ngpl\ngcb 42-fix-file-importer\ngpsup</code></pre></div>\n<hr>\n<p>I’ll go over my particular workflow in another post, and show you specifically how I use Git not only as my code repository, but also my task list. Stay tuned!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Git Wrokflow for Solo Development","date":"April 09, 2019","description":null,"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":4.8,"src":"/static/d5325c1c88fea329cfb835ba9c99248d/e8897/header.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d5325c1c88fea329cfb835ba9c99248d/6f766/header.jpg 300w,\n/static/d5325c1c88fea329cfb835ba9c99248d/9fdaa/header.jpg 600w,\n/static/d5325c1c88fea329cfb835ba9c99248d/e8897/header.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/git-solo-worflow/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/git-solo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Git for Solo Development"}},"next":null}}
